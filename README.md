# ft_printf
ft_printf one of the three projects you have to complete in this circle, it is essentially a recreation of the function printf,  where you want it to print out certain parameters that are based on their data types. It includes variadic functions, your very own printf function (ft_printf.c), and other functions that might help with this project! (Libft can be used here!)
